first experience about this wonderful world. But it was a kind of hobby
until year 2020 that i began studying web programming with a better
purpose in mind than a hobby. So that Node js was my pick, i
have been very interested on back-end frameworks like Express, and
related libraries to afford security and functionality like Bcrypt and
jsonwebtoken besides very useful concepts to reuse logic as for
example middlewares, I enjoy to write code using these technologies`;

export const attached_2 = `React is open-sourced by Facebook just a shy a few years ago, 
itâ€™s already become the number one choice for JavaScript devs around the globe. And i
have picked to work with this wonderful technology that brings so many advantages. However
Technology changes, and it changes quickly. I am open-minded to new technologies in order to
learn them and then also take advantage of them.`;
