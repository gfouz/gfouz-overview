# How to be a better programmer.\r
\r
![react wallpaper](/images/advices.jpg)\r
\r
## Get good at Googling.\r
\r
Being a programmer is all about learning how to search for \r
the answers to your questions. By learning to Google things \r
effectively, you'll save a lot of development time.\r
\r
## Write useful comments.\r
\r
Write comments which explain the "why" and not the "what".\r
\r
## Name variables and functions appropriately.\r
\r
Functions and variables should accurately denote \r
their purpose, so myCoolFunction won't fly.\r
\r
## Take vacations, invest time on other kind of things.\r
\r
We all need time to de-compress. Take that trip you've been \r
wanting. Your brain and your co-workers will thank you.\r
\r
## Delete unused code\r
No reason to accrue more technical debt.\r
\r
## Learn to read code\r
Reading code is an undervalued skill, but an invaluable one.\r
\r
## Pair program\r
Pair programming allows you to play the role of both teacher and student.\r
\r
## Get involved in the community\r
Surrounding yourself with like-minded people will motivate you to push through the lows.\r
\r
## Keep learning\r
You've chosen a profession that requires continuous learning. Learn to love it.\r
\r
## Don't give up\r
It won't always be easy. But we all started at the same place. You can do it.\r
\r
## Take tasks that scare you\r
If it doesn't scare you, it isn't going to help you grow.\r
\r
## Learn to love constructive criticism\r
Ask trusted colleagues and friends for constructive criticism. It will help you grow as a programmer and as a human.\r
\r
## Be open-minded\r
Technology changes, and it changes quickly. Don't oppose new technology; learn it and then form an opinion.\r
\r
## Stay relevant\r
Stay up-to-date on the latest tech news by following publications, blogs, podcasts, and tech news.\r
\r
## Focus on problem solving\r
Strong problem solving skills can conquer any problem. Hone in on what it takes to solve a problem.\r
\r
## Stay humble\r
No matter what title you hold or what company you work form, stay humble.\r
\r
## Learn to debug\r
Explore the browser debugger tools. Learn the ins-and-outs of debugging with your IDE. By learning the most effective methods for debugging a problem and tracing errors, you'll be able to solve even the most difficult bugs.\r
\r
## Exercise your current skills\r
Just because you currently know a skill doesn't mean you shouldn't exercise it. Skills fade with time unless consciously improved upon, and this industry evolves so rapidly it's important to keep practicing. Get out of the mindset that "I've always done it this way" and into the mindset of "Is there a better way to do this?"\r
\r
## Understand the why\r
There will be times when you have to voice your opinion, so it's important to understand the why behind it. Why is solution A better than solution B? Provide a valid argument and your opinions will be much more sound.\r
\r
## Know your worth\r
You are a commodity, and should be paid appropriately. Be aware of the industry averages in your geographic location. If you're making less money, it's time to have a chat with your manager. Go after what you deserve.\r
\r
## Don't be afraid to ask for help\r
If you're stuck on a problem and spending too much time searching for a solution, it's time to ask for help. We're all human. We all need help. There is no shame in reaching out to a colleague for support.\r
\r
## Learn to learn\r
People learn in different ways. Some learn best through video tutorials, others through reading a book. Figure out your learning style and practice it diligently.\r
\r
## Take breaks\r
It's nearly impossible to spend 8 consecutive hours coding. You'll burn out quickly and make a lot of mistakes. So set a timer to remind yourself to stop and take a break. Go for a walk. Get a coffee with a colleague. Stepping away from the screen will positively impact your productivity and the quality of your work.\r
\r
## Track your progress\r
Learning to code takes time and can be extremely disheartening when you don't see progress. So it's important to track your achievements and progress towards your goals. Keep a small list next to your computer and each time you achieve something, write it down, no matter how small. Atomic achievements compound to much larger rewards.\r
\r
## Don't choose the comfortable technology; choose the right one\r
Each project will have different needs, and as such we must choose the right tools for the job. Although it's comfortable to choose technologies you've worked with previously, if they don't suit the needs of the project, alternatives should be explored.\r
\r
## Take responsibility for your mistakes\r
All humans make mistakes and you will many many throughout your career. Thus it's important to own up and take responsibility when you've made a mistake. It will build trust with your team members and management.\r
\r
## Learn from your failures\r
Failure is simply not achieving the expected outcome, and is not necessarily a bad thing. We all have many failures during the course of our careers. Learn from your downfalls. What can you do differently next time?\r
\r
## Test your code\r
Tests are important. Unit tests, regression tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests. Test your code and your product will be much more stable.\r
\r
## Reduce ambiguity\r
Instead of writing convoluted code which shows off your snazzy programming skills, aim for readability and simplicity. This will make it easier for your team members to contribute.\r
\r
## Read documentation\r
Documentation is the purest source of truth about a technology, so learning to read it can quickly help you to become an expert.\r
\r
## Don't compare yourself to others\r
The only thing you should compare yourself to is who you were yesterday.\r
\r
## Apply for jobs you aren't qualified for\r
You will never meet every requirement for a job. So take a chance and apply! What do you have to lose?\r
\r
## Learn how to work from home\r
If you have the ability to work from home, learn to do so effectively. Find a separate office space, devoid of distractions. Boneskull wrote a great article on working from home you should check out.\r
\r
## Remember why you love programming\r
You got into this profession because it sparked an interest. If you're getting frustrated and resentful, take a break. Give yourself space to reignite your passion for programming.\r
\r
## Share your knowledge\r
If you learn something cool, share it! Present at a local meetup or conference. Teach your coworker or mentee during lunch. Sharing your knowledge reinforces your knowledge while spreading\r
the wealth.\r

# Wonderful ExpressJs!\r
\r
![node wallpaper](/images/node.jpg)\r
\r
## What is Node.Js ?\r
\r
Node.js is a JavaScript run time environment which is used to create server-side applications and tools. Node.js is fast, portable, and written in JavaScript but it does not directly support common tasks such as handling requests, serving files, and handling HTTP methods such as GET and POST. This is where Node.js\u2019s rich ecosystem comes to our aid.\r
\r
## What is Express.Js ?\r
\r
Express.js (Express) is a light web framework which sits on top of Node.js and it adds functionality like (middleware, routing, etc.) and simplicity to Node.js.\r
\r
## A brief explanation!\r
\r
When creating a Node.js web application, we write a single JavaScript application which listens to requests from the browser, based on the request, the function will send back some data or an HTML web page.\r
\r
## Request and Response objects.\r
\r
A request handler is a JavaScript function which takes a request and sends an appropriate response.\r
Node.js APIs can get complex and writing how to handle a single request can end up being over many lines of code. Express makes it easier to write Node.js web applications.\r
\r
\r
## Advantages of using Express with Node.js\r
\r
Express lets you take away a lot of the complexities of Node.js while adding helpful functions to a Node.js HTTP server.\r
Instead of a large request handler function, Express allows us to handle requests by writing many small modular and maintainable functions.\r
Express is not opinionated, meaning Express does not enforce any \u201Cright way\u201D of doing things. You can use any compatible middleware, and you can structure the app as you wish, making it flexible.\r
We can integrate with a template rendering engine (also called a view rendering engine in some articles) of our choice like Jade, Pug, EJS, etc.\r
A template engine enables you to use static template files and at runtime change the values of variables in those files.\r
You can set up \u201Cmiddleware\u201D for request processing.\r
\r
## What is a Middleware? \r
\r
Middleware is a set of functions that sit between a raw request and the final intended route. Middleware functions have access to all the HTTP requests coming to the server. Middleware can handle tasks such as logging, sending static files, authorization, and session management, etc.\r
\r
In Node.js, the request and response objects are passed to one function (request handler) that we write, in Express these objects are passed through a set of functions, called the middleware stack.\r
\r
Express will start at the first function in the stack and execute in order down the stack.\r
\r
Every function in the stack takes three arguments request, response and next. next is a function, that when called Express executes the next function in the stack. This is a subtle difference between middleware and a route handler which we saw above.\r
\r
Let\u2019s look at a basic static file server to understand middleware. Initialize a new npm project. Then create a directory named static and copy-paste any available static files into the folder (text, images, etc.).\r

![react wallpaper](/images/black.jpg)\r
\r
## Mutable o Inmutable.\r
\r
El desarrollo con datos inmutables es un principio fundamental de la\r
programaci\xF3n funcional que se est\xE1 extendiendo tambi\xE9n en la\r
programaci\xF3n orientada a objeto. Su planteamiento b\xE1sico es muy\r
sencillo: un dato u objeto, una vez creado, no puede ser cambiado,\r
manteniendo su estado original en todo momento. Si por alg\xFAn motivo se\r
tuviera que cambiar el dato, entonces se obtendr\xEDa una copia con los\r
datos modificados, pero nunca se cambian los valores originales. Lo\r
contrario a la inmutabilidad es la mutabilidad, es decir, la capacidad\r
para cambiar el valor o el estado de los elementos de un lenguaje de\r
programaci\xF3n. Cuando cambiamos el valor de una propiedad, o la\r
referencia de una variable, estamos haciendo uso de mutabilidad, es\r
decir, de la capacidad de cambiar.\r
\r
## Utilidad de 'const' en JavaScript.\r
\r
'const' nos va ayudar a declarar variables inmutables, esto es, a\r
declarar variables cuyo valor no pueda ser cambiado a lo largo del\r
ciclo de vida de una variable. si intentamos asignar un nuevo valor a\r
la constante, se nos lanzar\xE1 una excepci\xF3n con el error provocado.\r
Tenemos que tener cuidado cuando deseemos almacenar un objeto JSON en\r
una constante de JavaScript. cuando asignamos un objeto a una\r
variable, no estamos almacenando el objeto en si en esa variable, si\r
no que se est\xE1 almacenando una referencia al objeto. Se almacena el\r
puntero con la posici\xF3n donde se encuentra el objeto real. Por tanto,\r
si seguimos esta l\xF3gica, lo que \u2018const\u2019 est\xE1 convirtiendo en inmutable\r
no es el objeto en si, si no la referencia a ese objeto.\r
\r
\`\`\`js\r
(() => {\r
  const url = 'https://gist.github.com/';\r
  url = 'http://www.as.com'; // Lanza un error!\r
})();\r
\`\`\`\r
\r
#### Sin embargo, no se produce error al asignar nuevos valores a la propiedades de un objeto:\r
\r
\`\`\`js\r
(() => {\r
  const objeto = {\r
    nombre: 'Giovani',\r
  };\r
  objeto.apellidos = 'creo nueva propiedad, cuyo valor es mutable';\r
  objeto.nombre = 'cambio el valor, no se lanza ninguna excepci\xF3n';\r
\r
  console.log(any);\r
})();\r
\`\`\`\r
\r
Reitero lo anterior respecto a JavaScript, cuando asignamos un objeto a una variable, no estamos almacenando el objeto en si en esa variable, si no que se est\xE1 almacenando una referencia del objeto. Se almacena el puntero con la posici\xF3n en memoria donde se encuentra el objeto real.\r

\r
## What is React ?\r
\r
React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook which, among other things, was used to build Instagram.com. Its aim is to allow developers to easily create fast user interfaces for websites and applications alike. The main concept of React.js is virtual DOM. It is a tree based on JavaScript components created with React that mimics a DOM tree. It does the least amount of DOM manipulation possible in order to keep your React components up to date.\r
\r
## A little of history\r
\r
Firstly, React was deployed by Facebook in 2011 and 2012. Instagram was written entirely in React. According to JavaScript analytics service Libscore, React is currently being used on the homepages and other web pages of Netflix, Imgur, Bleacher Report, Feedly, Airbnb, SeatGeek, HelloSign, and others.\r
\r
## Why Use React.js for Web Development?\r
\r
Being a part of the JavaScript language, using React spawns lots of advantages. Products built with React are simple to scale, a single language used on the server/client/mobile side of things grants outstanding productivity, there are workflow patterns for convenient teamwork, UI code is readable and maintainable, and more. World-leading companies have used React and other JS technologies in some of the top market-defining products out there (Instagram, Reddit, and Facebook being the most vivid examples).\r
\r
But let\u2019s take a closer, more informed look at some particular reasons why use React and, more importantly, when to use React.js to tackle the most fitting goals and achieve outstanding results.\r
\r
## Mature, simple-to-grasp dev workflow\r
One of the major reasons to use React.js for web development is the library\u2019s ultimately optimized development interface and coding language. Thus, lightweight React\u2019s API is reinforced with fast performance capacities to achieve a hassle-free, rapid development workflow. React components and concepts are really simple to figure out so there is not much learning curve here.\r
\r
As opposed to other popular frameworks, like Vue and Angular, there is no barrage of extra HTML attributes (created when JavaScript is \u201Ccrammed\u201D into HTML - a standard practice for traditional frameworks and JS library solutions). In the long run, by putting JSX into JavaScript (literally going the other way round), React grants a much cleaner, better readable, more comprehensive code.\r
\r
## Ultimate flexibility and compatibility\r
\r
Using React.js for web development may come in extremely convenient because React is one of those cases where you get the hang of a single technology to easily reuse it across a range of platforms. And all due to being a library by nature, with the primary purpose of creating separate web design elements and components (anything from buttons and labels to grids and interactive features).\r
\r
On top of that, there is a significant contribution by the extensive, long-established community. React\u2019s current ecosystem is so vast that it enables developers to create desktop solutions and mobile applications, generate static websites, handle server rendering, and integrate advanced tech concepts (like VR and 360 views) with web solutions - all by similar, simple react web development guidelines and philosophies.\r
\r
## Hassle-free reusability of components\r
\r
We answer the ultimate question above - what is React.js used for in web development most particularly? For creating separate components. And this is exactly why created components can be easily reused. Once you\u2019ve created a React.js web application element, you get a unique object that can be added to any other project compatible with the React-based code.\r
\r
While a bigger general hierarchy is built out of those components (which are wrapped into higher-level components), each has a separate dedicated internal logic and rendering principle. This grants outstanding scaling opportunities helps to achieve much better React web app consistency and makes further support and optimization a piece of cake.\r

## we\u2019re going to look at reactivity in Vue.\r
\r
![react wallpaper](/images/coffee.jpg)\r
\r
## The non-reactive nature of JavaScript.\r
\r
this article, we\u2019re going to look at reactivity in Vue, how it works,\r
and how we can create reactive variables using newly created methods\r
and functions. This article is targeted at developers who have a good\r
understanding of how Vue 2.x works and are looking to get familiar\r
with the new Vue 3. We\u2019re going to build a simple application to\r
better understand this topic. The code for this app can be found on\r
GitHub. By default, JavaScript isn\u2019t reactive. This means that if we\r
create the variable boy and reference it in part A of our application,\r
then proceed to modify boy in part B, part A will not update with the\r
new value of boy.\r
\r
\`\`\`js\r
let framework = 'Vue';\r
let words = \`\${framework} is cool\`;\r
console.log(words);\r
// logs "Vue is awesome"\r
framework = 'React';\r
console.log(words);\r
//should log "React is awesome"\r
// if 'words' were reactive.\r
\`\`\`\r
\r
## Reactive properties.\r
\r
The snippet above is a perfect example of the non-reactive nature of\r
JavaScript \u2014 hence, why the change isn\u2019t reflected in the sentence\r
variable. In Vue 2.x, props, computed, and data() were all reactive by\r
default, with the exception of properties that are not present in data\r
when such components are created. This means that when a component is\r
injected into the DOM, only the existing properties in the component\u2019s\r
data object would cause the component to update if and when such\r
properties change. Internally, Vue 3 uses the Proxy object (an\r
ECMAScript 6 feature) to ensure that these properties are reactive,\r
but it still provides the option to use Object.defineProperty from Vue\r
2 for Internet Explorer support (ECMAScript 5). This method defines a\r
new property directly on an object, or modifies an existing property\r
on an object, and returns the object.\r
\r
## Composition Api.\r
\r
At first glance and since most of us already know that reactivity is\r
not new in Vue, it might seem unnecessary to make use of these\r
properties, but the Options API has its limitations when you\u2019re\r
dealing with a large application with reusable functions in several\r
parts of the application. To this end, the new Composition API was\r
introduced to help with abstracting logic in order to make a code base\r
easier to read and maintain. Also, we can now easily make any variable\r
reactive regardless of its data type using any of the new properties\r
and methods. When we use the setup option, which serves as the entry\r
point for the Composition API, the data object, computed properties,\r
and methods are inaccessible because the component instance has not\r
yet been created when setup is executed. This makes it impossible to\r
take advantage of the built-in reactivity in any of these features in\r
setup.\r
